## UX
**Web layout**

The Nigerian national colour is green and white, hence the choice of green and white colour on the website with grey colour as contrast.
Most of the texts are black and white in some cases for better visibility.

**Prospective website users**

The ideal visitors to this website are;

* Residents of Ireland looking for a Nigerian restaurant to dine in and hangout
* Residents of Ireland looking to hire catering for their events
* Visitors to Ireland looking for a Nigerian restaurant to dine in and hangout

Though there are other restaurants serving Nigerian meals in Dublin, they often drive sales by words of mouth with little or no online presence.
9ja-Bites will take advantage of its online presence to drive more sales and be open to residents and visitors alike for business.
